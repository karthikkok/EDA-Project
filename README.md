# **Project Title: Analyzing Laptop Prices on Flipkart**

---

### Overview

This project aims to analyze the prices of laptops available on Flipkart based on their specifications. It explores how various factors such as brand, processor type, RAM size, and storage capacity influence the pricing of laptops listed on the platform.

### Features

- **Data Collection**: Scraping or accessing data from Flipkart's listings using web scraping techniques.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the collected data to understand trends and relationships between laptop specifications and prices.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations (plots, graphs) to illustrate findings and insights.

### Technologies Used

- Python (BeautifulSoup, requests for web scraping; Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation; Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and visualization


### Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Run the data collection script (`scraping_data_flipkart.ipynb`) to fetch laptop listings from Flipkart.
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook scraping_data_flipkart.ipynb
   ```

2. **Data Analysis**: Use Jupyter Notebook (`flipkart_laptops.ipynb`) to explore and analyze the collected data.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook flipkart_laptops.ipynb
   ```

3. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to present findings and insights from the analysis.

### Directory Structure

```
|- `data/`                           # Directory containing necessary data files
|- scraping_data_flipkart.ipynb      # Script for data scraping or API access
|- flipkart_laptops.ipynb            # Jupyter Notebook for data analysis

```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/flipkart_laptops.git
   cd flipkart_laptops
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You may also need additional libraries used in your notebook, which should be listed in the notebook itself or in a requirements file.

3. **Open and run the notebook:**

   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `flipkart_laptops.ipynb`. Execute each cell to replicate the analysis or explore the findings interactively.

4. **Explore the analysis:**

   - Follow the structured analysis and code cells in the notebook.
   - Examine visualizations and interpret the results.
   - Modify or expand the analysis as needed.
